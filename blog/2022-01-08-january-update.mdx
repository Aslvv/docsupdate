We've rolled out our song favorites system along with a refreshed UI! âžœ

<!--truncate-->

<br />

### `Play` command gets **autocomplete** âœ¨

Do you hate typing out the exact song you want? With autocomplete, you can find your song in on average **6 characters or fewer** ðŸ¤¯

<br />

## Changed:

- Some minor tweaks to the UI
- Flow for creating playlists is easier now

## Fixed:
