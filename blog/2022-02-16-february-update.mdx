Refinement&#58; âš¡blazing fast performance & UX improvements. âžœ

<!--truncate-->

## When big update?

As Acoustic grows, so does its global reach. We strive to provide the same amazing service in Shanghai as we do in the States.
This update mainly deals with latency improvements and other backend refactoring. We have some ðŸ‘€ **big** stuff planned for Acoustic
coming next month, and this update has laid the foundation for that.

`TL;DR` We've reduced out memory footprint by `~50%` and decreased response time by `~30%`.

### Check out [/favorites](/favorites) for info on how to use favorites!

## Added:

- Improved nowplaying command <br />

## Changed:

- Split Acoustic into seperate processes
- New color palette
- New database (Over `197%` faster - not a typo)
- Internal API improvements - makes it easier for us to retroactively fix bigs
- Clearer distinction between a Discord error and an internal error
- Autocomplete query improvements

## Fixed:

- Favorites being corrupted by data collisions
- Fix filters delay after skipping
- Fix nondeterministic behavior when using the `skip` and `back` command simultaneously
- Fix bot leaving vc after a `close 1006 (abnormal closure)`
- Remove confliciting alias on `playnext`
- Reaction acessibility improvements
- Oversight that allowed unauthorized users to give themselves premium ðŸ˜…
- Completely fix `cyclic dependency error` when favoriting a song
- Follow through on interactions after a ratelimit error
- Deletion failing after a track ends
- And a lot more...
