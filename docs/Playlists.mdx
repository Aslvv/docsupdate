### Step 1: Making your playlist

- Run the `~create` command plus the name of the playlist you want to create along with the first song/playlist you want to add.

### Step 2: Playing your custom playlist

- Run the `~load` command followed by the playlist you wish to load.

## Optional steps:

### Viewing your custom playlist

- The `~view` command allows you to view your available playlists as well as hone in on a specific one.

### Deleting a specific song from a custom playlist

- The `~eliminate` command let's you delete a specific track number from your custom playlist. You can find the track number by running `~view <playlist>` and then `~eliminate <song number>`. An example is shown below:
